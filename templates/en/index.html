        Boston's Chinatown is home to many community-oriented cultural and activist organizations. These organizations, along with many longtime neighborhood residents, hold a wealth of historical collections of photographs, newsletters, flyers, recorded interviews, maps, meeting minutes, and more. In addition, many area libraries, archives, and museums host collections pertaining to Chinatown's history. In collaboration with Chinatown community partners, this website aims to document archival collections drawn from a diverse range of sources.

        This directory is intended as a launching point for neighborhood research, presenting indexes of these collections and the individuals and organizations connected to them.
